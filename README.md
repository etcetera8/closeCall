# Close Call Image Log
This project uses a ultrasonic distance sensor to determine the distance of objects passing a cyclist and capturing an image of cars that come within one meter.
It saves the image and will have a license plate reader scan the image and record a list of license plates, time of day, and gps location of the incident into a spreadsheet. Eventually it will note repeat license plates.
